## Introduction

SensEdu is equipped with x2 [AD8222] Instrumentation Amplifier ([datasheet]).

Each Amplifier is dual-channel, so we have 4 channels in total. All channels are accessible from the following Jumpers:
* J9: 1st Channel of U5 -> outputs MIC5 - A0 - ADC12_INP4
* J11: 2nd Channel of U5 -> outputs MIC6 - A2 - ADC12_INP9
* J12: 1st Channel of U6 -> outputs MIC7 - A11 - ADC12_INP0
* J20: 2nd Channel of U6 -> outputs MIC8 - A7 - ADC1_INP16

Refer to the [ADC mapping table](/SensEdu/Library/ADC/#adc_mapping) for better understanding.
