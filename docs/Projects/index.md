# Projects with SensEdu shield and Arduino GIGA R1 platform using SensEdu Library
{: .fs-8 .fw-500}
---

The following is the documentation of some of the projects already done by the developers of the board and the library. These projects aim to show how to use 
the board shield with Arduino GIGA R1 platform, and at the same time utilize the custom SensEdu Library. 

{: .note}
The SensEdu Library is *NOT* dependent on the SensEdu Board and Arduino GIGA platform, rather on the microcontroller of the platform you are using. 

As per the documentation for the board (insert link), the shield is mainly used as a tranciever utilizing the speakers and the microphones on the board. 
Therefore, some of the project ideas are: 
* ultrasound distance measurements - obtaining the distance of an object by measuring the TOF (*time-of-flight*) of the reflected signal
* data processing on MCU with cross-correlation algorithm - advanced signal processing 
* wifi communication - Arduino GIGA R1 platform supports WiFi communication which can be used for faster data transfer between two or more systems
* chirp signal generation - there are many different applications that utilize the chirp signal and the first part of those applications is having the actual chirp
* wheather station - with the pressure sensor provided on the SensEdu shield
