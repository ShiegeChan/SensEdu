# Projects with SensEdu shield and Arduino GIGA R1 platform using SensEdu Library
{: .fs-8 .fw-500}
---

The following is the documentation of some of the projects already done by the developers of the board and the library. These projects aim to show how to use 
the board shield with Arduino GIGA R1 platform, and at the same time utilize the custom SensEdu Library.

{: .note}
The SensEdu Library is *NOT* dependent on the SensEdu Board and Arduino GIGA platform, rather on the microcontroller of the platform you are using. 

As per the documentation for the board (insert link), the shield is mainly used as a *tranciever* utilizing the speakers and the microphones on the board. The speakers are transmitters working in the range of 32 kHz, while the microphones are receivers working in the range between 10 kHz and 100 kHz, and having resonant frequency of 32 kHz. Mainly, all of the applications utilize previously mentioned shield capability. Moreover, the board is equipped with a *barometric pressure sensor* which can have its own applications, or be combined with trancievers on the board. 

There are two main types of applications our board supports: 
* **Tranciever applications**
* **Barometric pressure sensor applications**
