## Introduction

For the whole ultrasonic implementation info etc, refer to main [Ultrasonic Ranging page]({% link Projects/UltraSound.md %}). This page contains only difference showcase: wifi implementation and GUI.

## Ideas
* develop this just for one channel
* button to switch between views: distance only like real time line running, then maybe raw data, xcorr, filtered etc.
* button to start/stop
* button to disable all detailed data transfer, allowing for fast only distance ones.
