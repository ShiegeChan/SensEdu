# DAC Peripheral
{: .fs-8 .fw-500 .no_toc}
---

A DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) converts a digital signal into an analog waveform, which is then sent to a speaker to produce acoustic waves. 
{: .fw-500}

- TOC
{:toc}

The STM32H747 features one DAC module with two available channels:
* ***Central Speaker***: connected to the first channel (channel 1) on `DAC0` pin 
* ***Bottom Speaker*** connected to the second channel (channel 2) on `DAC1` pin

The SensEdu library has advanced features accounting for ease of use and code efficiency. To specify the data to be sent, a lookup table (LUT) is used. Both channels of the DAC module are available. Moreover, there are 3 modes in which a waveform can be sent to the module: 

1. *burst mode* - sending LUT values for a specified number of times
2. *single mode* - sending LUT values once (or single burst mode)
3. *continuous mode* - sending LUT values continuously 

Each of the methods are usefull for different applications. 

## Errors

Main DAC error code is `0x30xx`. Find the way to display errors in your Arduino sketch [here]({% link Library/index.md %}#error-handling).

## Examples

Each example uses a LUT with specified (16-bit) values and size. An example of defining a sine wave of 64 samples is shown in the following code snippet

```c
const SENSEDU_DAC_BUFFER(buffer_name, buffer_size) = {...};
```
where the first parameter of *SENSEDU_DAC_BUFFER* is the user-defined ***name*** to be used in the program code while the second parameter is the ***size*** of the LUT. 

{: .note}
User can specify LUT size to be any positive integer. However, the real size of the DAC buffer has to be an integer devisible by integers raised by power of 2. See examples for more clarification. 

### Send_DAC_Variable_Wave

Example of modifying the predefined LUT during the program execution. 

1. Define the initial LUT 
2. Configure DAC channel
3. Initialize and enable DAC channel
4. Modify LUT in a loop while making sure it does not go out of bound
5. Check for errors


```c
#include <SensEdu.h>

static uint32_t lib_error = 0;
static uint8_t increment_flag = 1; // run time modification flag

const size_t lut_size = 4;
static SENSEDU_DAC_BUFFER(lut, lut_size) = {
    0x0000,0x0001,0x0002,0x0003
};

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    SensEdu_DAC_Settings dac_settings = {DAC_CH1, 64000*16, (uint16_t*)lut, lut_size, 
        SENSEDU_DAC_MODE_CONTINUOUS_WAVE, 0};

    SensEdu_DAC_Init(&dac_settings);
    SensEdu_DAC_Enable(DAC_CH1);

    lib_error = SensEdu_GetError();
    while (lib_error != 0) {
        delay(1000);
        Serial.print("Error: 0x");
        Serial.println(lib_error, HEX);
    }

    Serial.println("Setup is successful.");
}

void loop() {
    // modify lut
    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < lut_size; i++) {
        if (increment_flag) {
            lut[i]++;
        } else {
            lut[i]--;
        }
    }

    // out of bounds checks
    if (lut[0] == 0x0000) {
        increment_flag = 1;
    }
    if (lut[lut_size-1] == 0x0FFF) {
        increment_flag = 0;
    }
    
    // check errors
    lib_error = SensEdu_GetError();
    while (lib_error != 0) {
        delay(1000);
        Serial.print("Error: 0x");
        Serial.println(lib_error, HEX);
    }
}

```

### Send_DAC_Single_Sine

Example of sending a single instance of a predefined LUT with sine waveform. 

```c
#include <SensEdu.h>

uint32_t lib_error = 0;

// DAC transfered symbols
const size_t sine_lut_size = 64;
const SENSEDU_DAC_BUFFER(sine_lut, sine_lut_size) = {0x0000,0x000a,0x0027,0x0058,0x009c,0x00f2,0x0159,0x01d1,0x0258,0x02ed,0x038e,0x043a,0x04f0,0x05ad,0x0670,0x0737,
	0x0800,0x08c8,0x098f,0x0a52,0x0b0f,0x0bc5,0x0c71,0x0d12,0x0da7,0x0e2e,0x0ea6,0x0f0d,0x0f63,0x0fa7,0x0fd8,0x0ff5,

	0x0800,0x0737,0x0670,0x05ad,0x04f0,0x043a,0x038e,0x02ed,0x0258,0x01d1,0x0159,0x00f2,0x009c,0x0058,0x0027,0x000a};

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    SensEdu_DAC_Settings dac_settings = {DAC_CH1, 32000*64, (uint16_t*)sine_lut, sine_lut_size, 
        SENSEDU_DAC_MODE_SINGLE_WAVE, 0};

    SensEdu_DAC_Init(&dac_settings);
    SensEdu_DAC_Enable(DAC_CH1);

    lib_error = SensEdu_GetError();
    while (lib_error != 0) {
        delay(1000);
        Serial.print("Error: 0x");
        Serial.println(lib_error, HEX);
    }
    Serial.println("Setup is successful.");
}

void loop() {
    // check errors
    lib_error = SensEdu_GetError();
    while (lib_error != 0) {
        delay(1000);
        Serial.print("Error: 0x");
        Serial.println(lib_error, HEX);
    }
}
```

{: .note}
To send a continuous sine wave, the only modification would be DAC mode parameter, choosing SENSEDU_DAC_MODE_CONTINUOUS_WAVE. Similarly, to send a burst wave, choose DAC mode to be SENSEDU_DAC_MODE_BURST_WAVE with specified number of bursts as the last parameter of dac_settings. 

## Developer Notes

### DMA Streams

Each DAC channel occupies one DMA Stream:
* **Channel 1**: DMA1_Stream2
* **Channel 2**: DMA1_Stream3

{: .warning }
Avoid reusing occupied DMA streams. Refer to [STM32H747 Reference Manual] to find free available streams.

### Cache Coherence

When using DAC with DMA, you need to be aware of cache coherence problems. By default, the processorâ€™s data cache (D-Cache) boosts memory access speed, but this can conflict with DMA operations. The DMA controller transfers data directly between memory and peripherals without CPU involvement. The issue arises when CPU interact with memory handled by DMA, the processor might read outdated data stored in cache instead of the actual data in memory, as it is not aware of DMA transfers. 

You can think that it shouldn't be a problem for DAC, since the data is written from memory to peripheral, CPU doesn't read anything. The problem arises, because default Arduino **MPU** (Memory Protection Unit) configuration enables write-back policy for writing operations. There are two possible policies:
* **Write-through policy (WT)**: Data is written to both cache and memory
* **Write-back policy (WB)**: Data is written to the cache first

That means if you use WB policy and update DAC buffer (waveform), DMA may not see updates **unless the cache is explicitly cleaned**.

There are two ways to fix this:
1. Cache Cleaning
2. MPU Configuration

{: .warning}
SensEdu uses MPU Configuration for the DAC.

#### Cache Cleaning
{: .no_toc}

After updating the DAC buffer, explicitly clean the cache to force writes to physical memory. Use the CMSIS function `SCB_CleanDCache_by_Addr(mem_addr, mem_size)` with the following parameters:
* `mem_addr`: Memory address of the DAC buffer
* `mem_size`: Memory size **in bytes**

```c
// Update Buffer
for (uint16_t i = 0; i < buf_size; i++) {
    buf[i] = i;
}
// Clean Cache and Start DAC
SCB_CleanDCache_by_Addr((uint16_t*)buf, sizeof(buf));
SensEdu_DAC_Enable(DAC_CH1);
```

The cache cleaning procedure applies to the entire cache line. Therefore, it is essential to align your DAC buffer to the cache line and ensure its size is a multiple of the cache line size. For the STM32H747, the cache line is 32 bytes long and is defined in the macro `__SCB_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE`. For a `uint16_t` array, this means the number of elements must be a multiple of 16 (each element is 2 bytes). For example. valid sizes include 16, 32, 64, etc. Alignment is achieved using the `__attribute__` directive:

```c
const uint16_t buf_size = 128; // multiple of __SCB_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE/2
__attribute__((aligned(__SCB_DCACHE_LINE_SIZE))) uint16_t buf[buf_size];
```

#### MPU Configuration
{: .no_toc}

To avoid manual cache maintenance, configure the MPU to mark the DAC bufferâ€™s memory region as non-cacheable. This bypasses the cache entirely, ensuring DMA always accesses physical memory.

First, you need to ensure the correct buffer size. It must be a power of two (starting at 32 bytes) and aligned to its size. From STM32CubeMX MPU screenshot, you can see an example of proper sizes. 

![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/MPU_size.png)

The SensEdu library automates this with the `SENSEDU_DAC_BUFFER(name, user_size)` macro:
* `name`: Variable name to access the buffer later in code
* `user_size`: buffer size **in uint16_t**

```c
const uint16_t buf_size = 50;
SENSEDU_DAC_BUFFER(buf, buf_size);
for (uint16_t i = 0; i < buf_size; i++) {
    buf[i] = i;
}
```

{: .warning}
The `SENSEDU_DAC_BUFFER` macro allows **any** user-defined size. The library internally adjusts it to meet MPU requirements.

After buffer allocation, during `DMA_DACInit()` the library configures the MPU region using internal function `LL_MPU_ConfigRegion()` to enforce non-cacheable and non-bufferable memory region.
