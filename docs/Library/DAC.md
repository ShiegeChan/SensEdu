# DAC Peripheral
{: .fs-8 .fw-500 .no_toc}
---

A DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) converts a digital signal into an analog waveform, which is then sent to a speaker to produce acoustic waves.
{: .fw-500}

The STM32H747 features one DAC with two available channels:
{: .mb-1}
1. **Central Speaker**: connected to the first channel on `DAC0` pin 
2. **Bottom Speaker** connected to the second channel on `DAC1` pin
