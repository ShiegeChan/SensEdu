Timers allow precise event scheduling, such as creating delays or setting sampling rates for peripherals.

## Functions

### SensEdu_TIMER_DelayInit
Initializes the timer used for microsecond delays. Call it once in the setup before using delays.

```c
void SensEdu_TIMER_DelayInit();
```

### SensEdu_TIMER_Delay_us

Pauses program execution for a specified duration (blocking delay).

```c
void SensEdu_TIMER_Delay_us(uint32_t delay_us);
```

#### Parameters
{: .no_toc}
* `delay_us`: Delay duration in microseconds. Maximum: 4,294,967,295 Âµs.

## Examples

### Blink_Delay

Blinks a LED using microsecond delays.

1. Include the SensEdu library and declare the LED pin (`LED_BUILTIN` in this case)
2. Initialize the timer with `SensEdu_TIMER_DelayInit()`
3. Configure the LED pin as an `OUTPUT` using `pinMode()`
4. Use alternating calls to `SensEdu_TIMER_Delay_us()` and `digitalWrite()` in the main loop to toggle the LED state.

{: .note }
On Arduino GIGA R1 the built-in LED is active-low: `LOW` = on, `HIGH` = off.

```c
#include "SensEdu.h"

uint8_t led = LED_BUILTIN;

void setup() {
    SensEdu_TIMER_DelayInit();

    pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);
}

void loop() {
    SensEdu_TIMER_Delay_us(500000);
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
    SensEdu_TIMER_Delay_us(500000);
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);
}
```

## Developer Notes

### Timer occupation

Peripheral timers (ADC/DAC) are hidden, automatically configured and require no user involvement.

Timer allocation:
* **TIM1**: ADC sampling
* **TIM2**: delays 
* **TIM4**: DAC sampling 

{: .warning }
Avoid reusing occupied timers. Refere to [STM32H747 Reference Manual] to find free available timers. Be aware, future updates will assign dedicated timers to each ADC/DAC separately, which may occupy your custom timer.

### Frequency settings

Timer frequency is dependent on 3 parameters:
* Clock Frequency $$(CLK)$$
* Prescaler $$(PSC)$$: CLK divider
* Period $$(ARR)$$: Register containing the value up to which the count proceeds

$$TIM_{freq} = \frac{CLK}{PSC + 1} * \frac{1}{ARR + 1}$$

The CLK signal is derived from the APB1 and APB2 Timer Clocks, each running at 240MHz.

Prescaler is set to its minimum value to achieve the finest frequency adjustments, resulting in a step size of $$\frac{1}{120\text{MHz}} \approx 8.33\text{ns}$$.

| ARR | Period | Frequency |
|:----|:-------|:----------|
| 1   | 16.7ns | 60MHz     |
| 2   | 25.0ns | 40MHz     |
| 3   | 33.3ns | 30MHz     |
| 4   | 41.7ns | 24MHz     |
| 5   | 50.0ns | 20MHz     |

{: .warning }
When a user specifies a frequency for a DAC or ADC, the target value is automatically rounded to the nearest achievable frequency dictated by the timer's step. The lower target frequency, the higher the achievable precision.
