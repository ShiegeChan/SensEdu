Open the MATLAB script "plot_microphones_data.m". 
Before reprogramming Arduino code and uploading it, in matlab command window type: "arduino=[]". This command will clean the buffers. 

Open Arduino script "dev_arduino.ino". 
Make sure Arduino port is selected and same value in both of the scripts. 

To plot only the distance data coming from the Arduino, in Arduino script set: 
#define LOCAL_XCORR     true    
#define XCORR_DEBUG     false 

and in MATLAB script set   
PLOT_DISTANCE = true;
PLOT_DETAILED_DATA = false; 


To plot all the data (distance, raw, after filtering, after cross-correlation) in Arduino script set:
#define LOCAL_XCORR     true    
#define XCORR_DEBUG     true 

and in MATLAB script set: 
PLOT_DISTANCE = true;
PLOT_DETAILED_DATA = true;
