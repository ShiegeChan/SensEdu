# Edusense
Software for educational examples for RADAR and Communication. 

This repository includes the Arduino files for the control of the ADC and the DAC of the Arduino giga based educational demoboard. The signal frequency is 32 kHz, the lockup table is running at a sampling frequency of 32000*64 = 2.048 MHz equals a sammpling time of of 0.488 Âµs.

The Matlab file (main.m) starts the data transfer to the computer and creates the figures for raw data and signal processing of the ADC-data.
